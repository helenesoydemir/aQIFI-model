ðŸ”¬ Modeling Pathological Neural Dynamics via Mean-Field Reduction

During my internship, I worked on an extended AdEx neuron model that includes a slow variable to simulate impaired ion regulation, particularly under elevated extracellular potassium conditions [1]. This model captures pathological dynamics such as those observed in epilepsy.

ðŸ§  The goal was to reformulate the model within the Adiabatic Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (AQIF) framework, making it compatible with the MontbriÃ³ mean-field reduction method, and enabling its extension to the population level.

ðŸ“‰ This approach supports the derivation of a reduced neural mass model that preserves the essential dynamics of the original spiking network, paving the way for integration into large-scale brain simulations.
